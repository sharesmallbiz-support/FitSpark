# FitSpark API Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the FitSpark application to integrate the React client with the .NET FitSpark.Api backend, creating a unified single-server deployment.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Unified Deployment

- **Vite Build Configuration**: Updated to build React app into `FitSpark.Api/wwwroot`
- **Static File Serving**: Configured .NET API to serve React app from wwwroot
- **SPA Routing**: Added fallback routing to handle client-side navigation
- **Single Origin**: Both API and client served from same port (eliminates CORS issues)

### 2. Client Application Updates

#### Authentication Integration

- **API Types**: Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces matching C# DTOs
- **User Management**: Updated AuthContext to use `ApiUser` type from API
- **Login/Register**: Integrated with `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register` endpoints
- **Theme Handling**: Added conversion between API theme format ("Fun", "Aggressive", "Drill") and client format ("fun", "aggressive", "drill")

#### API Service Layer

- **Service Classes**: Created organized service layer (`authService`, `workoutService`, `progressService`, `videoService`, `achievementService`)
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Centralized API endpoint definitions in `apiConfig.ts`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with API DTOs

#### Data Structure Alignment

- **User Registration**: Updated form to match `UserRegistrationDto` structure
  - Changed from `name` to `firstName`/`lastName`
  - Changed from `startWeight`/`targetWeight` to `weightPounds`/`targetWeightPounds`
  - Added proper validation and field mapping
- **Theme Integration**: Seamless conversion between API and client theme formats

### 3. Build System

- **Unified Build**: Created scripts for building both client and API
- **PowerShell Script**: Added `build.ps1` for complete application build
- **Package.json Scripts**:
  - `build:client` - Builds React app to API wwwroot
  - `build:api` - Builds .NET API
  - `build:all` - Builds both client and API
  - `start:api` - Runs the unified application

### 4. Development Workflow

- **Development**: Run `dotnet run --project FitSpark.Api/FitSpark.Api.csproj` for full application
- **Production**: Same command, but with `--configuration Release`
- **Client Development**: Can still use Vite dev server for rapid development

## API Integration Details

### Endpoints Ready for Integration

1. **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*`
   - Login, register, user profile management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Workouts**: `/api/workouts/*`
   - Workout plan management
   - Daily workout creation and tracking
   - Exercise library integration

3. **Progress**: `/api/progress/*`
   - Daily progress tracking
   - Statistics and analytics
   - Progress history with filtering

4. **Videos**: `/api/videos/*`
   - YouTube video integration
   - Categories, ratings, featured content
   - User video ratings and reviews

5. **Achievements**: `/api/achievements/*`
   - Badge and achievement system
   - User achievement tracking
   - Leaderboards and points

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Single server hosts both API and client
2. **Better Performance**: No CORS overhead, reduced network calls
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with C# DTOs
4. **Scalability**: .NET backend provides better performance and scalability
5. **Professional Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with service layer
6. **Enhanced Features**: Access to comprehensive fitness tracking capabilities

### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Update dashboard to use workout and progress APIs
2. **Video Player**: Integrate with video management API
3. **Achievement System**: Connect achievement tracking throughout the app
4. **Progress Analytics**: Implement comprehensive progress visualization
5. **Admin Features**: Integrate admin video and user management
